Prior to the main task we ask that you complete some basic demographic information. <br> Following this you will be presented with a series of distorted images. We ask that you attempt to guess what each image may be and type your answer in the box provided. You will have <b>10 seconds</b> to make a guess once the picture has been presented. <br> Once you have made a guess you will be asked to rate your confidence in the answer you have provided and your curiosity towards the correct answer. <br>  After this you will be presented with the undistorted image. <br> Following this we ask that you complete some questionnaires about your characteristics/beliefs. <br> Finally, please remember, we ask that you pay careful attention to the pictures and read all text thoroughly.<br><br>
